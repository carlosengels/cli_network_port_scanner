SCANNING HOSTS AND NETWORKS THAT YOU DO NOT OWN, OR HAVE EXPLICIT PERMISSION TO SCAN SO CAN RESULT IN CRIMINAL CHARGES.
To inform and protect yourself read this article published by Nmap: https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html
!!!

DESCRIPTION:
CLI port scanner application that writes the results to a local file in JSON format. The JSON file is also used to keep
a list of the hosts that you've scanned including IP address, hostnames, profile name and port scan results.

The main menu allows you to navigate through the options of:
- Add a new host to list
- Scan all hosts
- Scan a Host
- Print open ports for all hosts
- Print open ports for a host
- More Options/Settings/Help
- Quit

The JSON format of the file allows it to easily interact with other security tools you might be using.

ROADMAP:
- Make PortScanner multithreaded so it doesn't take hours to fully scan a host with generous timeouts.
- Once multithreading is implemented, implement the ability to determine timeouts and port ranges and save those in a
 local save file
