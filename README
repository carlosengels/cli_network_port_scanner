# Multithreaded CLI Port Scanner

This is a a CLI tool that for determining the status of the TCP/UDP ports on a given IP address.

The port scanner allows for saving multiple hosts with their scan results in JSON format. Through the menu you can choose to scan indivual hosts or all saved hosts.

Additional functionality includes adjusting the port scan range and the conncetion timeouts (longer timeouts can give you more accurate results but will significantly impact the time it takes to scan a host).

## Warning
Scanning hosts and networks that you do not own or have explicit permission to scan can result in criminal charges.

To inform and protect yourself read [this article published by Nmap.](https://nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html)

## Usage

Once you compile and run the java code you will be shown a menu

```
1 - Add a new host to hosts.json
2 - Scan all hosts
3 - Scan a Host
4 - Print open ports for all hosts
5 - Print open ports for a host
6 - Remove a host from the existing host repository
7 - Settings/Other
8 - Quit
```
Note that when you scan hosts, the results are not immediately printed, but rather saved to the local JSON save file.
Other than that the menu is pretty much YGWYS. Through the Settings/Other menu you will be able to adjust default scanning settings.
