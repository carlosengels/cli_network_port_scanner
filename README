DESCRIPTION:
CLI port scanner application that writes the results to a local file in JSON format. The JSON file is also used to keep
a list of the hosts that you've scanned including IP address, hostnames, profile name and port scan results.

The main menu allows you to navigate through the options of:
- Add a new host to list
- Scan all hosts
- Scan a Host
- Print open ports for all hosts
- Print open ports for a host
- More Options/Settings/Help
- Quit

The JSON format of the file allows it to easily interact with other (security) tools.

ROADMAP:
- Make PortScanner multithreaded so it doesn't take hours to fully scan a host with generous timeouts.
- Once multithreading is implemented, implement the ability to determine timeouts and port ranges and save those in a
 local save file
